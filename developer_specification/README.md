# Overview

This guide explains MSX from the Service Development Architecture and Design point view. Goal is to give an overview of MSX 
capabilities and features, help understand how to develop for MSX and what can be developed and deployed.

# Prerequisites

Development for MSX follows MSX architecture. Here is a list of concepts that will help understand MSX structure. 
Service development has to take them into account.
