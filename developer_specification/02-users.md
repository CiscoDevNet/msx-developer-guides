# MSX Users

MSX users are persons using the system.

* User can be associated with one or more Tenants
* User can access data from the Tenant(s) it is associated with
* User can be created from MSX portal and have username and password stored in MSX
* User can be federated
* User can switch between Tenant Workspaces in MSX Portal
* User can have permissions to create other Users and Tenants.

MSX comes with preconfigured Super User that has access to entire MSX functionality. Super User can create other users
and associate them with tenants. Super User can also grant permissions to create other Users and Tenants to a user.

Answering the following questions will help position your service in MSX:
* Does My Service support Users?
* How do users of My Service map to MSX Users? 
* How does My Service align with MSX Users Model?

Note: Relationship between MSX Tenant and MSX is **association**. MSX Tenant **does not belong** to MSX User.
MSX User **does not belong** to MSX Tenant.

Note: Detailed list of preconfigured users can be found in the
[User Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/managed-services-accelerator/series.html).
