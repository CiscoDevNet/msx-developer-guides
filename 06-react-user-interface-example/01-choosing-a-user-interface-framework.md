# Choosing a User Interface Framework
* [Introduction](#introduction)
* [References](#references)

## Introduction
There are no hard rules about which framework to use for your user interface. However, we do recommend following our style guide [(help me)](/docs/reference/msx-ui-style-guide). Some options include:
* Angular
* React JS
* Vue JS
* Flutter

MSX supports Single Sign On (SSO) so choosing a framework with an SSO library will help.
